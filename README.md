Numerical and Statistical Analysis of the Higgs Boson Discovery
This submission is for Project 2: Discovering the Higgs boson. The following three .py files are contained:

a) Project_Task3.py
b) Project_Task4.py
c) Project_Task5+6.py

Each .py file corresponds to the Tasks given in the Project description script. The files must all be downloaded to the same location. They must be run in the order listed above. All plots and numbers presented in the report can be reproduced with the current parameters set in the .py files, so no changes are required â€“ cells must be run in order. Comments are included to help the reader identify which cells produced the referenced Figures in the report.
